# BLEFOTA
Bluetooth Low Energy based FOTA solution
BLE FOTA project is Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE, Bluetooth Smart) based FOTA(Firmware Over The Air) solution for IoT and etc. devices.
This solutioin helps to manage a variety of devices in a batch by using smart devices as a gateway and the server as a firmware management.
Because many IoT devices and small-things use BLE and etc. which are low-power, short range wireless communication technology.
There are three princiapl reasons that the BLE FOTA solution is useful. First, Devices are possible to perform continuous firmware update ont ehr side of performance and security. Second
